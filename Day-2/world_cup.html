      <u><b>Achievements</b></u>
      <p>
        Yadav was selected in the Indian cricket team to play against West
        Indies in October 2014 but did not appear in any match.[11] In February
        2017, he was added to India's Test squad for their one-off match against
        Bangladesh.[12] He made his Test debut for India against Australia on 25
        March 2017, at the Dharamshala Cricket Stadium, taking four wickets in
        the first innings.[13] Yadav is the first left-arm wrist spin bowler to
        represent India national cricket team in Test cricket. He is also only
        the third such bowler in Test cricket to take four wickets on debut. In
        June 2017, Yadav was named in India's squad for a limited overs tour to
        the West Indies.[14] He made his One Day International (ODI) debut for
        India against the West Indies on 23 June 2017.[15] However, during this
        game, he was unable to bowl a single delivery as the game ended with no
        result due to rain during the first innings while India was batting. He
        was ultimately able to bowl in the next match of the series, where he
        took three wickets.[16] He made his Twenty20 International (T20I) debut
        for India against the West Indies on 9 July 2017.[17] On 21 September
        2017, Yadav became the third bowler for India to take a hat-trick in an
        ODI after Chetan Sharma and Kapil Dev. He took the hat-trick at Eden
        Gardens, Kolkata, against Australia.[18][19] On 3 July 2018, Yadav took
        his first five-for in a T20I and also became the first left-arm
        wrist-spin bowler to take five wickets in a T20I during the first T20I
        against England, in fact he also became only the third Indian after
        Yuzvendra Chahal and Bhuvneshwar Kumar to take a five-wicket haul in a
        T20I.[20][21]

        Bumrah played first-class cricket for Gujarat and made his debut against
        Vidarbha in October 2013 during the 2013–14 season.[11] A right-arm
        fast-medium pacer from Gujarat with an unusual bowling action, Bumrah
        made his T20 debut against Maharashtra in the 2012–13 Syed Mushtaq Ali
        Trophy, and also helped his side clinch the title with his Man of the
        Match performance. His figures of 3/14 were instrumental to Gujarat's
        win over Punjab in the final.[12] A 19-year old Bumrah grabbed instant
        limelight when on his Indian Premier League (IPL) debut, he finished
        with figures of 3/32 against Royal Challengers Bangalore.[13] Though
        Bumrah played 2 matches in the Pepsi IPL 2013 for Mumbai Indians, the
        Mumbai Indians retained him for Pepsi IPL 2014 season.[14] On 11
        December 2020, he scored his maiden first class half century (55*)
        against Australia A during the India tour of Australia.[15]

      <u><b>Achievements</b></u>
      <p>
        Shami took four wickets on his senior debut for Bengal in a Twenty20
        match in October 2010.[14] He made his first-class cricket debut the
        following month against Assam at Eden Gardens, taking three wickets in a
        high scoring match.[15][16] In February 2012 his bowling helped East
        Zone win their first Duleep Trophy title; he took eight wickets in the
        match and was described as "outstanding, consistently getting bounce and
        zip from just short of a good length".[17] He had only played in the
        match following an injury to Abu Nechim, but it proved to be a
        significant breakthrough in Shami's career;[18] he had been described as
        "little-known" before the match,[19] but by April was being touted as a
        player to watch in the upcoming Indian Premier League season.[18] He was
        selected to tour the West Indies with the India A side and "impressed"
        with his bowling on pitches which were considered to be generally
        unhelpful to fast bowlers.[20] Shami was considered to have been the
        "surprise package" of the tour for India A, and impressed the team's
        coach Lalchand Rajput with his strength and consistency whilst bowling,
        as well as with his batting;[21] batting tenth in the first unofficial
        Test match, he scored 27 runs in a partnership of 73 with Cheteshwar
        Pujara which won the match for India A.[22] Later in the year he was one
        of only two fast bowlers retained for the India A tour of New
        Zealand,[23] although he only played in two of the six matches on the
        tour.[3]
